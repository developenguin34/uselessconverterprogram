# uselessconverterprogram
A basic program that runs python files that I wrote it because of I bored.

When you run program, ~~you have to select your os as linux by typing "L" or windows by typing "W"~~.Then, you will type path of your script to execute your script.
You don't have to write your operating system. It detects your operating system automatically in v0.2. You will type path of your script to execute your script.
